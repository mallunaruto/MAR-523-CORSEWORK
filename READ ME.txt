HELLO FUTURE ME,

THIS REPO IS JUST FOR YOUR REFERENCE TO NOT FORGET WHAT YOU DID AND IF YOU CAN DEVELOP ON IT AND ANY OTHER HAPPY SOUL LOOKING AT THE CODE FOR GO AHEAD
USE THE CODE GO AHEAD AND BLAST AWAY. 
THIS REPO ALSO INCLUDES LOESS INTERPOLATION MATLAB CODE AND YOU WOULD NEED THE OTHES 'LOESS' FUNCTIONS TO GET IT WORKING
PROPERLY.

LOOK FOR THE FILE NAME AND YOU WOULD FIND THE CODE,eg:MULTIBEAM,is for MBES etc.

YOU COULD DO LOESS INTERPOLATION BY USING SCIKIT,BUT THERE IS SOME PARAMETERS TO UNDERSTAND 
BEFORE DOING IT  SO LOOK INTO IT.
NEED TO INSTALL GEORASTERS FOR PROVESSING.
